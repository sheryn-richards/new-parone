Golf data is notoriously fragmented. Between launch monitors, GPS trackers, and official scoring, there is no single standard.

## The Unification Layer

We built a standardized ingestion pipeline that normalizes various telemetry formats into a unified JSON schema. This allowed SwingU to leverage real-time analytics for their user base without worrying about the underlying hardware differences.

## Features

- **Real-time processing:** Shot data available in < 50ms.
- **Predictive modeling:** Providing flight path predictions based on initial telemetry.
- **Global API:** Highly available endpoint for mobile and web consumers.
