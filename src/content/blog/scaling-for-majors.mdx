Major championships present a unique traffic profile: 99% idle followed by massive, instantaneous spikes when a leader reaches the final holes.

## Infrastructure Strategy

To handle this, we implemented a "warm-standby" architecture across multiple cloud providers. Our load balancers are tuned for rapid horizontal scaling, spinning up new instances in response to telemetry indicators before the traffic actually hits our edge.

## Key Metrics

- **Uptime:** 99.999% during the entire tournament window.
- **Throughput:** Peak of 1.2TB/s during the Sunday afternoon window.
- **Latency:** Global average of 14ms.
