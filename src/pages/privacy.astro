        <h3 class="text-white" data-ps="src/pages/privacy.astro:smlsqz">Information Collected By The Corporate Website</h3>
        <p data-ps="src/pages/privacy.astro:brhx97">Our Corporate Website provides information about our company, business, and the services we provide. It is also the portal used by our customers to sign into the customer dashboard for the ParOne Services. The Corporate Website collects Personal Data, Usage Data, and Tracking Data when you visit the site at www.ParOne.com.</p>
        
        <p data-ps="src/pages/privacy.astro:brhx98">“Personal Data” is the information about an individual that can be used to identify that individual. If you access the Corporate Website from the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, we use a different definition of Personal Data to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
        
        <p data-ps="src/pages/privacy.astro:brhx99">“Tracking Data” is the information collected by cookies and similar tracking technologies (e.g., pixel tags, web beacons, or scripts) that we use to keep track of visitor activity on the Corporate Website. (Note that the Tracking Data collected by the ParOne Technology is different, and is discussed in Section B.)</p>
        
        <p data-ps="src/pages/privacy.astro:brhx9a">Cookies are small files that contain a small amount of data, typically including a unique identifier. They are generally placed on your browser by a website or other browser-based service. Our Corporate Website uses cookies. Other tracking technologies, in the context of the Corporate Website, include pixel tags, web beacons, and scripts, and are used to track usage and performance.</p>

        <p data-ps="src/pages/privacy.astro:brhx9w">“Usage Data”, in the context of the Corporate Website, is the information that your browser sends to ParOne’s servers when you visit the Corporate Website. As with other Internet services, our web servers gather information automatically each time your browser or device interacts with the Corporate Website, and store that information in “log files.”</p>

        <h3 class="text-white" data-ps="src/pages/privacy.astro:smlsqy">Note for visitors who access the Corporate Website from the EEA, Switzerland or the UK:</h3>
        <p data-ps="src/pages/privacy.astro:brhx9x"><strong>Personal Data:</strong> In the EEA, Switzerland and the UK, Personal Data is defined differently than in the U.S., and means a variety of data that identifies or can identify a particular unique user or device (e.g., names, addresses, cookie identifiers, mobile device identifiers, precise location data and biometric data).</p>
